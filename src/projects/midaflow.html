                    <h2>What is enterprise resource planning?</h2>
                    <h3>Enterprise resource planning (ERP) <strong>is a comprehensive software system designed to</strong> integrate and streamline 
                        various aspects of an organization's core business activities. <strong>It serves as a centralized hub that connects different 
                        departments and functions within the organization such as:</strong></h3>
                    <img src="/src/assets/midaflow/Context.svg">
                    <h3>The founders of Midaflow saw a gap in the market. <strong>Predominantly, ERP software systems were only accessible to large 
                        organizations with the resources to afford such a comprehensive enterprise solution.</strong> They believed that ERP software 
                        systems should be more accessible and easy-to-use for small and medium-sized businesses. For Midaflow, they focused <strong>
                        their efforts on the financial aspects of an ERP software system, specifically focusing</strong> on Finance & Accounting, 
                        Analytics & Reporting, and Purchasing.</h3>

                    <h2>But what did I know about enterprise resource planning?</h2>
                    <h3><strong>Not much, to be honest.</strong> Prior to Midaflow, I had no idea what an ERP software system even was. 
                        <strong>This would have posed a significant challenge for me when designing for this system.</strong>
                        However, I did notice some similarities between ERP software systems and Shopify<strong>, for which I do have extensive
                        knowledge and experience in.</strong></h3>
                    <img src="/src/assets/midaflow/Research.svg">
                    <h3>Both systems integrate and streamline various aspects of core business activities, and serve as a centralized hub for their organization.
                        <strong>This comparison helped me understand the core concept of an enterprise resource planning software system.</strong></h3>
                    <h2 class="pt-8">Learning what works and what doesn't</h2>
                    <h3><strong>Given the project's time constraints and the extensive research already conducted by the founders, further research was not a priority. </strong>
                        So in order for us interns to get a better idea on what could be improved, we conducted discovery research by analyzing user feedback 
                        on our competitors. This allowed us to identify their strengths and weaknesses.</h3>
                    <img src="/src/assets/midaflow/User Feedback.svg">
                    <h3>Based on the feedback, we can see that users value a product that is easy-to-use and reliable. They appreciate intuitive designs tailored for 
                        both end-users and administrators, as well as strong customer support. However, the wide range of features can overwhelm and confuse users, 
                        and persistent issues with supplier integration despite support being the primary issues that require improvement.</h3>
